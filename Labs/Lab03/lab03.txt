strcpy(3): The strcpy() function copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the buffer pointed to by dest.  The strings may not overlap, and the destination string dest must be large enough to receive the copy.

strncpy(3): The strncpy() function is similar to strcpy(), except that at most n bytes of src are copied.  Warning: If there is no null byte among the first n bytes of src, the string placed in dest will not be null-terminated.

strcmp(3): The strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  The locale is not taken into account. The comparison is done using unsigned characters.

strncmp(3):  The strncmp() function is similar to strcmp(), except it compares only the first (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.
