(4.1) What do you observe when the block size is increased from 8 to 64 for a 8K direct-mapped cache? What principle of cache operation is responsible for this effect?


(4.2) What do you observe when you double the size of the direct-mapped cache (from 8K to 16K) while keeping the block size at 8? Discuss these results relative to your results from question 1. Is a bigger cache necessarily better?


(4.3) What is the performance of a direct-mapped cache with sizes 32K, 64K, 128K, 256K, and 512K using a block size of 32? Is there a significant impact on the miss rate?


(4.4) What is the effect of setting 2-way and 4-way set associativity for an 8K cache with a block size of 8? Is this what you expected? Explain your findings.


(4.5) What is the effect of setting 2-way and 4-way set associativity for a 128K cache with a block size of 8? Compare them to previous results and explain your findings.



(Ex6) Your final challenge is to select a cache design that provides a good balance between low miss rate and small size on the blocked cache trace above. In your answers file create a new section for Exercise 3.  Be sure to document your analysis and provide several experiments to support your conclusion using the blocked trace. Clearly demonstrate the effect of each cache parameter. Your goal is to demonstrate that blocking allows us to use a smaller cache to achieve similar performance as the naive algorithm. In your answers.txt file write a few paragraphs summarizing your experiments, results, and conclusions.
