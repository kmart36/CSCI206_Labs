1. What gcc flag is needed to generate debug information in your compiled program?
   -g
2. How do you set a breakpoint?
   break <line number> or b <line number>
3. How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
   next or n
4. If the next line of code is a function call, you'll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. (If not, consider a different command for #3!) How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead? (If you changed your answer to #3, then that answer is most likely now applicable here.)
   step or s
5. How do you resume the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
   c or continue
6. How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
   print or p
7. How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
   info local
8. How do you print a trace of how your program got to where it is?
